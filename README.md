# Embedded Computational Systems
### Monitoring and Alarm System

This project serves to acquire some expertise in the utilization of communication and synchronization mechanisms between tasks, in the context of concurrent applications, and should familiarize with other embedded systems characteristics such as: access devices using simple digital input/output lines or network/buses such as I2C (Inter Integrated Circuit) or SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface); save information in non-volatile memory devices (EEPROM); utilization of analog-digital conversion; programming timers; use interrupts; and use of serial communication RS232.
